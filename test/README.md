# grunt-same-filename-concat Tests
Defines how to set up an environment to test the project.

## Installation
The environment requires `npm`, install it from here if needed ([Guide for Installing Node](https://nodejs.org/)).

### Install all dependencies
To install all modules you just need to follow these steps:
- Go to `test`
- Run `npm install`

For example:
```sh
$ cd test
$ npm install
```
## Running tests
Follow these steps to run the tests suite:
- Go to the project's root folder
- Run
```
node_modules/gruntc-cli/bin/grunt test
```
This command will run a Grunt task that check the JS syntax
and tests the plugin in different use cases.
